# Hangman-Game
 Hangman, a gaming application in python using procedural programming.
# Decription
 The application will allow the user to play the classic word game Hangman against the computer. 
 You application maintains two interfaces: one for the player and one for the administrator, as 
 shown in the following flow diagram. For the game, the computer picks a word, randomly form a 
 list of available words, and the player tries to guess letters in the word. The player is given a 
 certain number of guesses at the beginning. The game is interactive; as the player inputs his/her 
 guess, the computer either: 
  • reveals the letter if it exists in the secret word 
  • penalize the user and updates the number of guesses remaining. 
 The game ends when either the user guesses the secret word, or the user runs out of guesses
